# Guitar Subset

For a list of integers S and a target number G, a subset of S that adds up to G is called a guitar subset. 

**For example:**
```
Input: 
24
[12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2]
Output: 
[12, 9, 2, 1]
```
(G=24, S=[12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2], there is a guitar subset [12, 9, 2, 1] that adds up to 24).

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive. 

Write a program to check if the user input has a guitar subset for the specified number G or not (both the list of integers and the number G are input parameters).
