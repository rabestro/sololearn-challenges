# Deficient Numbers

A number is considered deficient if the sum of its factors is less than twice that number.

For Example:
```
10 is a deficient number.
Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10
Sum is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 < 2 * 10
```
## Tasks:

(Easy) Write a program to verify whether a given number is deficient or not.
(Medium) Write a program to find all the deficient numbers in a range.
(Hard) Given a number, write a program to display its factors, their sum and then verify whether it's deficient or not.
