# Lab Numbers

A lab number is a number such that the square of any of its prime divisors is still one of its divisors.

**For example:**

```
Input: 8
Output: true (2 is a prime divisor of 8, and 2x2=4 is also a divisor of 8)

Input: 50
Output: true (5 is a prime divisor of 50, and 5x5=25 is also a divisor of 50)
```

Write a program to check if the user input is a Lab number or not.

> Bonus: Print all the Lab numbers in a given range.
