# Goldbach's Conjecture

Goldbach's conjecture is a rule in math that states the following: every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. 

Write a program that finds every possible pair of prime numbers, whose sum equals the given number or a set of numbers within a range.

For example:
```
Input: 16
Output:
3 + 13
5 + 11

Input: 32
Output: 
3 + 29
13 + 19

Input: 4, 8
Output: 
4: 2 + 2  
6: 3 + 3  
8: 3 + 5
```
