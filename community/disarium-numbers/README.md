# Disarium Numbers

A number is called a Disarium number if the sum of the powers of its digits equals the number itself. The digits are powered to their positions in the number.

For example:
```
Input: 135
Output: true
```
135 is a Disarium number because it equals to 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 (each digit powered to the position in the number).

Write a program to check if the user input is a Disarium number or not.

> Bonus: Print all the Disarium numbers in a given range.
