# Ugly Numbers

A number is considered to be ugly if its only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. 

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, …] is the sequence of ugly numbers.

> By convention, 1 is also included.

## Task:

Create a program which takes a number n as input and checks if it's an ugly number.

## Hint:

An ugly number U can be expressed as: U = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a, b and c are non-negative integers.
