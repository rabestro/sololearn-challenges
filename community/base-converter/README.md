# Base Converter

In mathematics, a base is the number of different digits or combination of digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. 
For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system. Because "dec" means 10, it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9.
A decimal number has base 10, a binary has base 2, an octal has base 8, etc.

Given a non-negative integer & a base as input, create a program to convert the given decimal into the corresponding base.

Some Examples:
```
Input: 25 7
Output: 34

Input: 368 4
Output: 11300

Input: 78 3
Output: 2220
```
