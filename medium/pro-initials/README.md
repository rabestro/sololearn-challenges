# Initials  

You are given a list of names for a fundraiser, but you need to keep the names relatively anonymous. You are tasked with getting the **initials** for each name provided.

## Task: 
Given a list of first and last names, take the first letter from each name to create initials and output them as a space-separated string.

## Input Format: 
The first input denotes the number of names in the list (N). The next N lines contain the list elements as strings. 

## Output Format: 
A string containing the initials of each name in the original list, separated by spaces.

## Sample Input: 
```
3 
Nick Dunburry
Tommy Newborne
David James
```
## Sample Output: 
```
ND TN DJ
```
## Explanation:
Taking the first letter from each name results in the output **ND TN DJ**.
