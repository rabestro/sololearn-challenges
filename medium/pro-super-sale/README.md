# Super Sale  

Your favorite store is having a sale! You pay full price for the most expensive item that you get, but then you get 30% off of everything else in your purchase! How much are you going to save? 
Sales tax is 7%. 
Also, you leave anything below a dollar in your saving as a tip to the seller. If your saving is a round amount, you don't leave any tips.

## Task: 
Given the prices of items you want to purchase, determine how much you will save during your shopping! 

## Input Format: 
An string of numbers separated by commas that represent the prices for all of the items that you want to purchase (without tax).

## Output Format: 
An integer number that represents the total savings that you got for shopping during the sale.

## Sample Input: 
```
100.25,80.99,40.00
```
## Sample Output: 
```
38
```
## Explanation: 
With the sale, you would get 30% off of the second two items. The amount you save is $36.297, and $38.83779 when you consider the 7% tax. After leaving the 0.83779 as a tip, your final saving is **$38**.
