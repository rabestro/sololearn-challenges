# Divisible  

You need to know if a number is divisible by each of a group of other numbers. If you are given the number and the group of other numbers, you will test to make sure that it is divisible by all of them.  

## Task: 
Test your number against all of the other numbers that you are given to make sure that it is divisible by them.

## Input Format: 
Two inputs: an integer value (the number you are testing) and a string of variable length of the integers that you should test against separated by spaces.

## Output Format: 
A string that says 'divisible by all' or 'not divisible by all'.

## Sample Input: 
```
100
2 5 10
```
## Sample Output:
