# Deja Vu  

You aren't paying attention and you accidentally type a bunch of random letters on your keyboard. You want to know if you ever typed the same letter twice, or if they are all unique letters.

## Task: 
If you are given a string of random letters, your task is to evaluate whether any letter is repeated in the string or if you only hit unique keys while you typing.

## Input Format: 
A string of random letter characters (no numbers or other buttons were pressed).

## Output Format: 
A string that says 'Deja Vu' if any letter is repeated in the input string, or a string that says 'Unique' if there are no repeats.

## Sample Input: 
aaaaaaaghhhhjkll

## Sample Output: 
Deja Vu

## Explanation: 
Your program should output 'Deja Vu' because there are many repetitions in 'aaaaaaaghhhhjkll'.
