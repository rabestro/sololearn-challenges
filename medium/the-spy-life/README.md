# The Spy Life  

You are a secret agent, and you receive an encrypted message that needs to be decoded. The code that is being used flips the message backwards and inserts non-alphabetic characters in the message to make it hard to decipher.

## Task: 
Create a program that will take the encoded message, flip it around, remove any characters that are not a letter or a space, and output the hidden message.

## Input Format:  
A string of characters that represent the encoded message.

## Output Format: 
A string of character that represent the intended secret message.

## Sample Input: 
d89%l++5r19o7W *o=l645le9H

## Sample Output: 
Hello World

## Explanation: 
If you remove everything that isn't a letter or space from the original message and flip it around, you get 'Hello World'.
