# Camel to Snake  

The company you are working for is refactoring its entire codebase. It's changing all naming conventions from camel to snake case (camelCasing to snake_casing). 
Every capital letter is replaced with its lowercase prefixed by an underscore _, except for the first letter, which is lowercased without the underscore, so that SomeName becomes some_name.

## Task: 
Write a program that takes in a string that has camel casing, and outputs the same string but with snake casing.

## Input Format: 
A string with camelCasing.

## Output Format: 
The same string but with snake_casing.

## Sample Input: 
camelCasing

## Sample Output:
camel_casing

## Explanation:
The capital C was lowercased and prefixed by an underscore.
