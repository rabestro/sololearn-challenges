# Ballpark Orders  

You and three friends go to a baseball game and you offer to go to the concession stand for everyone. They each order one thing, and you do as well. Nachos and Pizza both cost $6.00. A Cheeseburger meal costs $10. Water is $4.00 and Coke is $5.00. Tax is 7%.

## Task 
Determine the total cost of ordering four items from the concession stand. If one of your friend’s orders something that isn't on the menu, you will order a Coke for them instead.

## Input Format
You are given a string of the four items that you've been asked to order that are separated by spaces.

## Output Format 
You will output a number of the total cost of the food and drinks.

## Sample Input 
'Pizza Cheeseburger Water Popcorn'

## Sample Output 
26.75

## Explanation
Because Popcorn is not on the menu, this friend gets a coke which brings the subtotal to $25.00 and $26.75 with tax.
