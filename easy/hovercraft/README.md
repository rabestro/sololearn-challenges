# Hovercraft

You run a hovercraft factory. Your factory makes ten hovercrafts in a month. Given the number of customers you got that month, did you make a profit? It costs you 2,000,000 to build a hovercraft, and you are selling them for 3,000,000. You also pay 1,000,000 each month for insurance.

## Task: 
Determine whether or not you made a profit based on how many of the ten hovercrafts you were able to sell that month.

## Output Format:
