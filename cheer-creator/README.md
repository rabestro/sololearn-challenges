# Cheer Creator

You are cheering on your favorite team. After each play, if your team got over 10 yards further down the field, you stand up and give your friend a high five. If they don't move forward by at least a yard you stay quiet and say 'shh', and if they move forward 10 yards or less, you say 'Ra!' for every yard that they moved forward in that play.

## Task 
Given the number of yards that your team moved forward, output either 'High Five' (for over 10), 'shh' (for <1), or a string that has a 'Ra!' for every yard that they gained.

## Input Format 
An integer value that represents the number of yards gained or lost by your team.

## Output Format 
A string of the appropriate cheer. 

## Sample Input 
3

## Sample Output
Ra!Ra!Ra!

## Explanation
If your team gains 3 yards you would cheer 'Ra!' three times for that play.
